# PhoneBook
This is a phone book application that 
lets you store, edit, delete, and search 
contacts using their unique ids. Whenever 
you create a new contact, the app will ask 
you for their name, phone number, email, 
and address, and assign them an id 
automatically. You can also log in to the 
app to secure your contacts and prevent 
unauthorized access. The app uses 
input/output operations to save and 
retrieve contacts from a text file. 
The app also has a user-friendly interface 
that makes it easy to manage your contacts.
